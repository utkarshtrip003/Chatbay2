              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Founded in 2024, Quick Help emerged from a simple frustration:
              finding reliable house help shouldn't take days or weeks. Our
              founders, busy professionals themselves, experienced the stress of
              managing households while juggling demanding careers. They
              envisioned a world where quality help could arrive at your
              doorstep in just 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              What started as a local service in one city has grown into a
              nationwide network of trusted service providers. We've helped
              thousands of families reclaim their time and enjoy cleaner, more
              organized homes without the hassle of traditional hiring
              processes.
